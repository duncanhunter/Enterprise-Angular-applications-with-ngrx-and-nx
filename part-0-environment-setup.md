# Part 0 - Environment setup

Dependency checklist:

1. node v4+
2. git
3. cli.angular.io
4. nrwl schematics

The main dependency for being able to make an Angular application is node version 4+. The latest stable version of node is best to get if you do not have it already installed.

You can check your version of node by running the following command in the terminal.

```
node -v
```

If you would like to use source control and check out completed work then it is recommended to have git installed on your machine. You can download git from[ https://git-scm.com/downloads ](https://git-scm.com/downloads )

 You can check your version of node by running the following command in the terminal.

```
git --version
```

If you do not have node installed or you are using a version lower than v4 then I you can get the latest stable version from [www.nodejs.org](/www.nodejs.org).

We need to have both the Angular CLI and the nrwl schematics installed globally. Run the following commands.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

```
npm install -g @nrwl/schematics
```
